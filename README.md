# Investigating-FBI-Gun-data

The data comes from the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System. The NICS is used by to determine whether a prospective buyer is eligible to buy firearms or
explosives. Gun shops call into this system to ensure that each customer does not have a criminal record or isn’t otherwise ineligible to make a
purchase. The data has been supplemented with state level data from census.gov.


● The NICS data is found in one sheet of an .xlsx file. It contains the number of firearm checks by month, state, and type.
● The U.S. census data is found in a .csv file. It contains several variables at the state level. Most variables just have one data point per state (2016), but a few
have data for more than one year.
